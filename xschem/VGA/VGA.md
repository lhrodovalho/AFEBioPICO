VGA: Variable Gain Amplifier based on cascaded inverting amplifiers and folded cascode OTAs with class AB output stage [2] 

The VGA is designed with 2 stages and an analog mux to select a gain between 20, 40 or 60dB. The output DC coupling is also accomplished by using pseudo-resistors. The OTA used for this design is the same as the one used for the LNA, but the dimensions of the transistors were reduced, because this block is not the bottleneck of noise requirements.
