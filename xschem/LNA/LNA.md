Low-Power Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) [1]

The LNA is designed with a voltage subtractor topology using capacitive impedances with a `nominal gain of 20dB`. Due to the low frequency corner specification, the output DC coupling is accomplished using `high resistance pseudo-resistors`. A symmectrical OTA is used as the transconductor element. The OTA transistors are big in order to reduce the flicker noise (1/f).
